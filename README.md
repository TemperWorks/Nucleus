# Nucleus UI Kit

> The central and most important part of an object, movement, or group, forming the basis for its activity and growth.

The Nucleus UI Kit is designed to be the centerpiece of our front-end work over at Temper. It is a UI library based on [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) with a simple API. Its designed is inspired by Material Design with a big influence of our amazing designers. The Nucleus UI Kit is no exact implementation of the Material design spec.

## Sidenote

Nucleus is **not** a CSS framework, and as such you won't find a grid system or styles for typography in it. Instead, the focus is on creating reusable components that have interactivity.

## Documentation and demo
[http://temperworks.github.io/Nucleus](http://temperworks.github.io/Nucleus/index.html)

## Requirements
* [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) (^v2.1.4)

Optional
* [Roboto font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) (Normal 400, Medium 500)
* [Material Icons font](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web)

## Browser support
IE 10+ (due to [Flexbox support](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)).

## Installation

### NPM (recommended)

```bash
npm install nucleus-ui-kit --save
```

### Building from source
* Download [source](https://github.com/TemperWorks/Nucleus/archive/master.zip)
* Run
```
npm build:all
```
* Build files can be found in dist/

## Usage
> Make sure to include either the `dist/nucleus-ui-kit.css` or `dist/nucleus-ui-kit.min.css` file if you are not using individual components from `lib/` as the styles have been extracted into a single CSS file.

##### CSS Reset

Before using Nucleus, ensure that the following CSS resets are applied to your site.

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

html {
    font-size: 100%;
}
```

You can add it to your stylesheet manually (before other styles), or, if you are using a CSS framework, check to see if the framework already includes a reset (most CSS frameworks do). The root font size [can be customized](Customization.md#component-sizing) to globally resize the components.

### ES6

*The following examples can also be used with CommonJS by replacing ES6-specific syntax with CommonJS equivalents.*

Use as a plugin (registers all components with Vue globally):

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import NucleusUI from 'nucleus-ui-kit';

Vue.use(NucleusUI);

new Vue({
    components: {
        // all Nucleus UI Kit components already registered
    }
});
```

Use individual components:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import { UiAlert, UiButton } from 'nucleus-ui-kit';

new Vue({
    components: {
        UiAlert,
        UiButton
    }
});
```

### Globals (script tag)

First, add a stylesheet link to the Nucleus CSS file in `dist/nucleus-ui-kit.min.css`. Then, add a script tag pointing to `dist/nucleus-ui-kit.min.js` *after* adding Vue.

If Nucleus detects `Vue` globally, all the components will be registered automatically. The components will also be made available on the global `window.Nucleus` object.

Example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/nucleus-ui-kit.min.css">
    ...
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        <ui-button>Hello world!</ui-button>
    </div>

    <script src="path/to/vue.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/nucleus-ui-kit.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        new Vue({
            el: '#app',
            components: {
                // all Nucleus components already registered
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Using *standalone* individual components

Each component has been compiled as a self-contained file which you can use without importing the rest of the library. The standalone files are located in the `lib/` folder and they contain their own CSS which will be added as `<style>` tags in `<head>`.

**NOTE**: Files in the `lib/` folder contain all their own dependencies and a lot them contain overlapping dependencies. As such, using multiple files from `lib/` could significantly increase the size of your bundle due to duplicate code, and is not recommended unless you are using only a handful of components. This *may* be fixed by minification, but I haven't tested.

### ES6

*The following examples can also be used with CommonJS by replacing ES6-specific syntax with CommonJS equivalents.*

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import 'nucleus-ui-kit/src/bootstrap'; // Required when using components from `lib/`, should be imported only once in your project
import UiButton from 'nucleus-ui-kit/lib/UiButton';

new Vue({
    components: {
        UiButton
    }
});
```
